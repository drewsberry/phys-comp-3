# Notes

* y_max can be anything equal to or more than maximum value of P', but if it is more, then more values of x' aren't used so it becomes less efficient in terms of accuracy per random number produced
* Might want to compare the time efficiency of the Python native library and numpy ways of doing the techniques - numpy is *insanely* faster!
