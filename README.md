## Computational Physics, Exercise 3: Random Numbers and Monte Carlo

This repository contains the code for Exercise 3 of Computational Physics 301, on random number generation and distributions and Monte Carlo simulation.
The contents of the code is split in two:

* Generating random numbers following a particular distribution using:
	* an analytic inversion method
	* a _reject-accept_ method (conceptually similar to standard Monte Carlo techniques).
* Simulating the distribution of gamma rays, produced by the decay of a beam of unstable nuclei, detected in a nuclear physics experiment.
