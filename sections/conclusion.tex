In conclusion, random numbers distributed as functions are essential for Monte Carlo simulations. An analytic method of producing random numbers distributed as sin is presented, with a general non-analytic reject-accept method providing random numbers distributed as any valid user-input function. The analytic solution is then used to produce correctly evenly distributed random points on a sphere, which is used to model the random decay of a beam of nuclei, releasing $\gamma$-rays in random directions. These random angles are combined with the positions of decay to calculate the reading a detector would find, accounting for the limiting resolution of the detector.
