# Base code directory

So there are three subdirectories, containing the three programs that I wrote for this exercise:

- analytic_sin: This contains the program that analytically inverts sin to produce a sinusoidal random number distribution.

- distributor: This contains the program that distributes random number as any user-input function, using the reject-accept method.

- gamma: This contains the program that simulates the nuclear decay and detector readings, as well as an extra file containing the interactive Mayavi illustration that shows how choosing evenly distributed random angles on a sphere produces clumps.

There are three more READMEs in each of these folders, containing program specific information.

In addition, running the program with -h/--help always prints out some useful information about the relevant flags and the program's purpose.
